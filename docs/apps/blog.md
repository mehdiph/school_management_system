# Blog App Documentation

The `blog` app is the school's blog («وبلاگ نسل قلم»): posts by teachers, the counselor
and other staff, in sections such as «پرورشی» and «مشاوره». Who may write is granted per
person and per section by the website admin; editors review and publish in the admin.
The rules are in ADR-026; the plan is `docs/plans/2026-10-blog-plan.md`.

**State (October 2026):** built on `feature/blog` in three phases, merged once after Phase 3.

| Phase | Contents | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Foundations | models, migrations, seed; body pipeline and sanitizer; permissions; workflow services; admin (editor, review, bulk actions); Trix vendored | done |
| 2. Public blog | public pages, preview, SEO, feeds, sitemap, robots, CSP, menu, teachers page link | done |
| 3. Authoring area | «نوشته‌های من» in the panels, sidebar item, login landing | done |

Authors write in «نوشته‌های من» (§7); editors review and publish in the admin (§5).

---

## 1. Models (`blog/models/`)

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BlogPage` | Singleton (`pk=1`, `website.models.base.SingletonModel`): the blog's name and intro, the three safety texts (D16) and SEO |
| `Section` | «پرورشی»، «مشاوره»: title, Unicode slug, one-line description, paper colour (a fixed choice, `Paper`), order, `is_active` |
| `Category` | Optional second level inside a section; slug unique per section |
| `Tag` | Free label; one row per spelling-independent `key` (`blog.text.search_key`) |
| `BlogAuthor` | One per person: the `user` (`PROTECT`), public byline (`display_name`, `slug`, `bio`, `photo`, optional `teacher_card`), `show_profile`, `is_active` («اجازه نوشتن») |
| `AuthorSection` | A section an author may write in, with `granted_by` and `granted_at`; unique per (author, section) |
| `Post` | The post; see below |
| `PostImage` | An image inside a post's body, uploaded from the editor (re-encoded, at most 1600 px, `width` / `height` stored) |
| `PostAwaitingReview` | Proxy of `Post`: the admin's «در انتظار بررسی» queue |

### Post

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `section`, `category` | Both `PROTECT`. The category must be in the section, and is required when the section has active categories (`Post.clean`) |
| `author` | `BlogAuthor`, `PROTECT` |
| `title` (120), `slug` (unique, Unicode) | The slug is generated from the title on first save and does not follow later title changes. Once published it should not change; only the admin can edit it, with a warning |
| `excerpt` (300) | Blank → `summary`, the first ~200 characters of the text |
| `body` | Sanitized HTML (§2) |
| `cover`, `cover_alt` | Re-encoded, at most 1600 px; the alt text is required with a cover |
| `tags` | At most `BLOG_MAX_TAGS_PER_POST` |
| `status` | `draft` «پیش‌نویس», `submitted` «در انتظار بررسی», `published` «منتشرشده», `archived` «بایگانی». A published post with a future `published_at` shows as «زمان‌بندی‌شده» |
| `published_at` | Set when published; kept after unpublishing. Database constraint: a published post has one |
| `submitted_at`, `privacy_ack_at`, `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `review_note` | Stamped by the services |
| `body_text`, `search_text`, `toc`, `reading_minutes` | Derived on every save (§2) |
| `content_updated_at` | Set when the title, body or excerpt change after publication |
| `meta_title`, `meta_description` | Blank → title and summary |

Indexes: `(status, published_at)`, `(section, status, published_at)`, `(author, status)`.

**The public rule** is one `Q`, `blog.models.post.public_q(prefix)`, used as
`Post.objects.public()` and inside counts (sections, categories, tags, the admin): status
published, `published_at <= now`, section active. There is no scheduler: a scheduled post
becomes public when its time comes. An inactive category or tag doesn't hide a post.

**Moments are written in UTC.** django_jalali stores a `jDateTimeField` value as text with
its own offset on SQLite, and a loaded row holds Tehran-time jdatetimes; re-saved as they
were, an edited post would compare as 3½ hours in the future and drop out of the public
pages. `Post.save()` writes `published_at`, `submitted_at`, `privacy_ack_at`,
`reviewed_at` and `content_updated_at` in UTC, and queries compare with `utc_now()`.
PostgreSQL compares instants and was never affected.

**Files:** every image field (`BlogPage.og_image`, `BlogAuthor.photo`, `Post.cover`,
`PostImage.image`) is removed from storage after commit when replaced or deleted
(`blog/signals.py`, reusing `website.signals`). `Post.save()` also deletes inline images no
longer in the body, once they are a day old (younger ones may still be in an editor that
hasn't saved yet).

## 2. The body: editor and sanitizer (`blog/content.py`, `blog/text.py`)

The editor is **Trix 2.1.19**, vendored in `static/vendor/trix/` (version, source and
SHA-256 of each file in its README, checked by `blog.tests.test_assets`).
`blog/js/editor.js` is loaded before Trix, configures it (Persian toolbar, «عنوان» = `h2`,
«زیرعنوان» = `h3`), and mounts it over the field's own textarea. Without JavaScript the
textarea is the editor: text without tags becomes paragraphs at blank lines.

`content.prepare(html)` runs in `Post.save()`, whatever path saves:

1. **Reshape** Trix's markup: its block `<div>`s become `<p>`, split at blank lines (two
   `<br>`); `h1` → `h2`, `h4`–`h6` → `h3`, `b`/`i`/`s` → `strong`/`em`/`del`; each image
   attachment becomes `<figure><img src alt width height><figcaption>`, with the caption
   also as `alt`; figures are lifted out of paragraphs; empty blocks are dropped.
2. **Sanitize** with `nh3` (`content.sanitize`), the allow-list of ADR-026:
   tags `p h2 h3 strong em del a ul ol li blockquote br hr figure figcaption img pre`;
   `a[href]` (http, https, mailto, relative, `#`; `rel="noopener noreferrer"` added);
   `img[src alt width height]` only for `src` under `MEDIA_URL` + `blog/`; `h2`/`h3` `id`.
   `script`, `style`, `iframe`, `object`, `svg`, `math`… are removed with their content.
   Links whose address is refused are left as text.
3. **Derive**: heading ids from the text (Unicode, de-duplicated) and the table of contents
   (`toc`: level, id, title); `body_text` (one line per block); `reading_minutes`
   (`BLOG_WORDS_PER_MINUTE`, at least 1); `search_text`.

`sanitize` is idempotent and is run again when a body is shown (the `body` template
filter, `blog/templatetags/blog_tags.py`). `to_editor` turns
a stored body back into Trix's attachment markup, so captions survive editing.

**Persian text** (`blog/text.py`): `normalize` fixes ي/ى→ی, ك→ک, tatweel, repeated
spaces and stray ZWNJ, and keeps ZWNJ, ئ and digits as typed (titles, names, tags).
`search_key` folds spellings for matching: also ئ→ی, ۀ→ه, أ/إ/آ→ا, diacritics removed,
digits to ASCII, lower case, and **no ZWNJ and no spaces**, so «کتاب‌خوانی»،
«کتاب خوانی» and «کتابخوانی» are the same key. Tags are unique on that key.

**What Trix can't do** (found in the Phase 1 spike):
- Enter adds a line break inside the block, never a new block; the server makes the
  paragraphs (blank line = new paragraph).
- A numbered list pasted from Word arrives as lines starting «1.», «2.»; tables arrive as
  text; images pasted from Word (local files) are dropped.

## 3. Who can do what (`blog/permissions.py`)

| Function | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `author_for(user)` | The user's `BlogAuthor` (one query with the user and staff record, cached on the user) |
| `write_block_reason(author)` | Why they can't write now, in Persian, or "" (the admin's «وضعیت نویسندگی») |
| `can_write(user)` | Active author, active account, eligible role, active staff record (if any) |
| `writable_sections(user)` | Active sections granted to them; none when they can't write |
| `can_write_in(user, section)` | |
| `author_posts(user)` | Their own posts: where every authoring view starts |
| `can_edit_as_author(user, post)` | Own draft in a section still granted |
| `author_edit_block_reason(user, post)` | Why the author can't edit their post now (submitted, published, scheduled, archived, section taken away), or "" |
| `author_required` | Decorator of the authoring views: logged out → login; can't write → a 403 page that says to ask the website admin |
| `is_editor(user)` / `can_publish(user)` | Active staff with `blog.publish_post` |
| `can_preview(user, post)` | The post's author (while they can write) and editors |

`BLOG_AUTHOR_ROLES` (setting) is read only here. The admin may only pick users of those
roles for a new author; an author whose role later changes can still be opened and
deactivated, but can't write.

## 4. Workflow (`blog/services.py`)

Every transition locks the post (`select_for_update`), checks the state it starts from and
who asks, and raises `TransitionError` (Persian message) or `PermissionDenied`.

| Service | From → to | Who | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_draft` | → draft | author, in a granted section | |
| `save_draft` | draft → draft | the author | the stored row locked and still a draft, the new section granted, the slug unchanged once published (a save from a stale tab is refused) |
| `submit` | draft → submitted | the author | privacy acknowledgement, title and text, valid category |
| `withdraw` | submitted → draft | the author | |
| `archive` | draft → archived | the author | (the soft delete; nothing is removed) |
| `reopen` | archived → draft | the author or an editor | |
| `publish` | draft / submitted / archived → published | editor | every checklist line ticked; `at` (default now, future = scheduled) |
| `unpublish` | published → archived | editor | (also unfeatures) |
| `return_to_author` | submitted / published / archived → draft | editor | a note |
| `set_featured` | | editor | only published posts are featured |
| `sync_tags`, `parse_tag_names` | | | existing tags reused in any spelling; at most 5 |
| `merge_tags` | | admin action | re-tags posts, deactivates the merged tags |
| `add_image` | | the author of a draft, or staff with `change_post` | jpg/png/webp, 2 MB; re-encoded |

Publishing a **draft** is possible only from the post's own review page, which warns that
the author never sent it (an editor's own post written in the admin). The bulk action
publishes only submitted and archived posts.

## 5. Admin (`blog/admin.py`)

| Entry | Contents |
|---|---|
| «صفحه وبلاگ» | Singleton: name and intro; the privacy reminder, acknowledgement and review checklist (one line per item); SEO and the default share image |
| «بخش‌ها» | Paper colour (swatch in the list), order, active, published posts count; categories inline |
| «برچسب‌ها» | Search in any spelling; published posts count; action «ادغام در برچسب دیگر…» (confirmation page) |
| «نویسندگان وبلاگ» | User (autocomplete, eligible roles), «اجازه نوشتن», sections as checkboxes (each grant records who and when, shown in «سابقه اجازه‌ها»), «وضعیت نویسندگی» with the reason when they can't write, public byline |
| «نوشته‌ها» | List with status badge («زمان‌بندی‌شده» too), filters (status, section, category, author, featured), search. Form with the Trix editor (images after the first save), tags autocomplete, cover. The status is read-only |
| «بررسی و انتشار» | `admin/blog/post/<id>/review/`, a link on the change form for editors: the checklist, «اکنون» or a Jalali date and time (`۱۴۰۵/۰۸/۱۲ ۱۰:۳۰`, Tehran time), «بازگرداندن به نویسنده» with a required note, «خارج کردن از انتشار» |
| Bulk actions | «انتشار…» (confirmation page with the checklist), «خارج کردن از انتشار», «ویژه کردن», «برداشتن از ویژه‌ها»; shown only to editors |
| «در انتظار بررسی» | Submitted posts, oldest first, with «ویرایش» and «بررسی و انتشار» links; needs `view_post` or `change_post` |
| Image upload | `admin/blog/post/<id>/upload-image/` (POST, JSON `{url, width, height}` or `{error}`): the editor's one JSON endpoint; needs `change_post` |

Posts are never deleted by editors (superusers only, for spam or test rows); archive instead.

### Setting up editors and authors

1. Create a group «ویراستار وبلاگ» with every `blog` permission, including «انتشار،
   زمان‌بندی، لغو انتشار و بازگرداندن نوشته‌ها» (`publish_post`), and add the editors
   (staff users).
2. Create the categories under «بخش‌ها» (suggestions in the plan, D15).
3. Add each author under «نویسندگان وبلاگ» and tick their sections.
4. Check the texts on «صفحه وبلاگ».

## 6. The public blog

### URLs (`blog/urls.py`, namespace `blog`)

| URL | Name | Page |
|---|---|---|
| `/blog/` | `home` | masthead, sections, up to 3 featured posts, the latest posts (paginated, without the featured ones), tags |
| `/blog/post/<slug>/` | `post` | a public post; anything else is a 404, for everyone |
| `/blog/preview/<id>/` | `preview` | any post, for its author (while they can write) and editors; 404 for anyone else; a public post redirects to its URL; `noindex` |
| `/blog/section/<section>/` | `section` | the section's posts and its category chips (categories with public posts) |
| `/blog/section/<section>/<category>/` | `category` | the category's posts |
| `/blog/tag/<tag>/` | `tag` | 404 while the tag is inactive or has no public post |
| `/blog/author/<slug>/` | `author` | 404 while `show_profile` is off or the author has no public post |
| `/blog/search/?q=` | `search` | title, excerpt and text in any spelling (`search_key`); two letters at least; `noindex` |
| `/blog/feed/`, `/blog/section/<section>/feed/` | `feed`, `section_feed` | Atom, newest `BLOG_FEED_ITEMS`, title + summary + link (not the full text) |
| `/sitemap.xml` | `sitemap` (project) | the site's pages (`website.sitemaps`) and the blog's (`blog.sitemaps`): home, active sections, categories / tags / author pages with public posts, public posts with `lastmod` |
| `/robots.txt` | `website:robots` | disallows the panels, the admin, `/auth/`, `/blog/write/`, `/blog/preview/`; points to the sitemap |

Lists take `?page=`; a page that doesn't exist is a 404. The category slug `feed` is
reserved (`RESERVED_CATEGORY_SLUGS`), since that URL is the section feed: typed in the admin
it is refused, and a title that would make it gets `feed-2`.

### Code

- `blog/selectors.py`: every page's data, each in a fixed number of queries (below).
- `blog/views/public.py`: thin views, `require_safe`, each under `public_csp`.
- `blog/seo.py`: `PageMeta` per page (title, description, canonical, Open Graph, feed link,
  breadcrumbs, JSON-LD), rendered by `blog/_meta.html`.
- `blog/feeds.py`, `blog/sitemaps.py`, `website/sitemaps.py`, `website.views.robots_txt`.
- Templates `blog/templates/blog/`: `base_public.html` (extends `base.html` with the
  public navbar), `home.html`, `listing.html` (section, category, tag, author and search),
  `post.html`, and partials (`_sheet`, `_grid`, `_pagination`, `_byline`, `_toc`, `_share`,
  `_author_box`, `_avatar`, `_stickers`, `_breadcrumbs`, `_search_form`, `_meta`).
- `blog/static/blog/css/blog.css` (the design, plan §4), `blog/static/blog/js/blog.js`
  (only «کپی پیوند» and the masthead's one-time settle; every page works without it).

### Query counts (locked in `blog.tests.test_public.QueryCountTests`)

With 1 post or 13 posts and 13 tags; the navbar and footer are 3 of each.

| Page | Queries |
|---|---|
| home | 9: page row, sections with counts, featured, count, latest, tags |
| section, category | 8: the section or category, chips, count, posts, page row |
| tag, author | 7 |
| search | 6 |
| post | 9: post, its tags, related, newer, older, page row |

Related posts: up to 3, the same category first, then shared tags, then the same section.
Newer / older: within the post's section.

### Security and privacy

- **CSP (D12):** `django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware` is installed with
  `SECURE_CSP` empty, so only views that set a policy send one: the blog's public views and
  the preview, through `public_csp` (`default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`,
  `font-src` `'self'`; `object-src 'none'`; `base-uri`, `form-action`, `frame-ancestors`
  `'self'`). The rest of the site sends no CSP.
- **No inline styles or scripts** on blog pages, except the JSON-LD data blocks (which are
  not scripts); a test parses every public page for `style` attributes, `<style>`,
  inline `<script>`, `on*` attributes and `javascript:` URLs.
- **JSON-LD** is escaped like `json_script` (`<`, `>`, `&` as `\u` escapes).
- **The author's account** gives only their first and last name (when there is no display
  name). The photo is the author's own or their teacher card's, never the account avatar
  (ADR-025). A test fills the account and staff record with marker values and checks that
  none reaches any blog page, feed or the sitemap.

### Design (plan §4, «روزنامه دیواری»)

The painted wall (`--bl-wall`), white sheets with a pinking-shear edge (CSS mask) and a
strip of tape in the section's paper colour, photo corners on covers. The masthead's words
are cut-outs of coloured card; on the first visit of a session they drop onto the board
once (never with reduced motion). Sheets lean slightly on desktop grids and straighten on
hover and focus; the post page is a straight sheet with its table of contents as a yellow
sticky note from 1200 px (a `<details>` below). A print stylesheet prints the post alone,
with its address. The variable Vazirmatn (`static/fonts/Vazirmatn-Variable.woff2`) is used
inside `main.bl` only.

### The site around it

- `website.0014_blog_menu`: the seeded menu row «وبلاگ» still at `#` → `/blog/`; the
  seeded «مقاله» row (still at `#`) is hidden, not deleted. Edited rows are left alone.
- The navbar marks «وبلاگ» on every page under `/blog/` (`website_tags.nav_state`);
  `aria-current="page"` stays on the exact page only.
- The teachers page: a card whose linked author has a public author page shows «نوشته‌های
  … در وبلاگ» (D21), in one query for all cards.
- Admin: «مشاهده در سایت» on a post opens its preview; the review page and the
  «در انتظار بررسی» queue link to it too.

## 7. The authoring area: «نوشته‌های من»

Where authors write (D6), in their own panel's shell: teachers in the teacher panel
(`blog/templates/blog/write/teacher/`, `ui-*` components), everyone else in `base.html` with
the sidebar and the supervisor panel's components (`blog/write/panel/`), like the director
panel. Authors are never made staff and never use the admin.

| URL | Name | Page |
|---|---|---|
| `/blog/write/` | `write` | Their posts with tabs «همه»، «پیش‌نویس»، «در انتظار بررسی»، «منتشرشده» (scheduled too)، «بایگانی» and counts; a returned draft shows the editor's note |
| `/blog/write/new/` | `write_new` | A new draft; with no section granted, back to the list with a message |
| `/blog/write/<id>/` | `write_edit` | Their draft in the editor; any other state read-only, with the reason (`author_edit_block_reason`) and the step left: «پس گرفتن برای ویرایش» (submitted), «برگرداندن به پیش‌نویس» (archived) |
| `/blog/write/<id>/<action>/` | `write_action` | POST: `withdraw`, `archive`, `reopen` |
| `/blog/write/<id>/image/` | `write_image` | POST: an image into their draft, JSON like the admin's endpoint |
| `/blog/write/profile/` | `write_profile` | «معرفی من»: their bio and photo (the name and the page switch stay with the admin) |

- **Access** (`author_required`, plan §6): logged out → login; anyone who can't write
  (student, a non-author of any role, staff and editors without an author row, an
  inactive author, account or staff record, a role no longer eligible) → 403. Another
  author's post, or an id that isn't theirs → 404. Transitions and uploads are POST only.
- **The editor form** (`AuthorPostForm`): section (only granted ones; hidden with one),
  title, body (Trix, `blog/js/editor.js`), excerpt, category, tags as text («کتاب‌خوانی،
  اردو»), cover with alt text, SEO fields, and the slug while the post was never
  published. The workflow fields are never in the form. «ذخیره پیش‌نویس» saves
  (`services.save_draft`); «ارسال برای بررسی» needs the acknowledgement of «صفحه وبلاگ»,
  saves, then submits; a draft that can't be sent (no text) is saved with a message.
  «بایگانی» posts the same form to `write_action` (no nested forms). Images can be added
  after the first save, as in the admin.
- **Preview**: «پیش‌نمایش آخرین ذخیره» opens `/blog/preview/<id>/` (§6).
- **`blog/js/write.js`**: character counters, a confirmation before archiving, a warning
  before leaving unsaved changes. Every page works without it.
- **Login** (D7): `accounts.utils.role_dashboard` sends a user with no panel and no staff
  flag who can write (a counselor) to `/blog/write/`. Roles with a panel keep it.
- **Sidebar**: «نوشته‌های من» in the teacher sidebar (`i-pen` icon) and in
  `partials/sidebar.html` for every role but students. It shows while the user can write,
  through `blog_can_write` from `blog.context_processors.authoring`: a `SimpleLazyObject`,
  so its one query runs only on pages that render a panel sidebar, never on public pages
  (approval change 1). A counselor's sidebar has only this item.

### Query counts

- The list (`blog.tests.test_write.ListTests`): 13 with 1 and with 13 posts: the 9 every
  panel request makes (session, user, staff, branch access and assignments, supervisor
  and student profiles, site settings, footer links) plus the author, the tab counts,
  the page count and the posts.
- Every panel page that renders a sidebar, for any user but a student: **+1** (the
  authorship check; `author_for` caches it, so the blog's own views reuse it). Fragments
  (`?partial=1`) render no sidebar and don't run it. Locked counts updated: the director's
  home 20 → 21 and attendance 19 → 20 (`director/tests.py`), the supervisor's sessions
  22 → 23 and teachers 16 → 17 (`supervisor/test_training_sessions.py`).

## 8. Settings (`teachlog/config/settings/base.py`)

| Setting | Value | Read in |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOG_AUTHOR_ROLES` | teacher, counselor, supervisor, director, admin | `blog.permissions` (policy, D3) |
| `BLOG_WORDS_PER_MINUTE` | 180 | `blog.text.reading_minutes` |
| `BLOG_PAGE_SIZE` | 9 | `blog.selectors.paginate` |
| `BLOG_MAX_TAGS_PER_POST` | 5 | `blog.services.sync_tags`, the admin form |
| `BLOG_FEED_ITEMS` | 20 | `blog.feeds` |
| `BLOG_TOC_MIN_HEADINGS` | 3 | `blog.selectors.PostPage.show_toc` |

`INSTALLED_APPS` also gains `django.contrib.sitemaps` (no tables).

## 9. Migrations

| Migration | Contents | Reverse |
|---|---|---|
| `blog.0001_initial` | All tables, constraints, indexes, the `publish_post` permission | drops them |
| `blog.0002_seed` | The «صفحه وبلاگ» row; sections «پرورشی» (tomato) and «مشاوره» (sky). Create only | removes the seeded sections no post uses |
| `website.0014_blog_menu` | «وبلاگ» at `#` → `/blog/`; active «مقاله» at `#` → hidden | resets «وبلاگ» still at `/blog/`; re-activates an inactive «مقاله» still at `#` |

## 10. Tests (`blog/tests/`)

`test_content` (sanitizer, Trix reshaping, round trip, Persian text), `test_models`,
`test_permissions` (every role), `test_workflow`, `test_admin`, `test_migrations`,
`test_assets` (no external script or stylesheet in any blog template or stylesheet;
vendored Trix matches its README), `test_public` (visibility on every page, feed and the
sitemap; preview; each page; search spellings; query counts; CSP and the inline check;
private data), `test_seo` (meta, JSON-LD, feeds, sitemap, robots), `test_write` (the
authoring area for every role of plan §6, the editor form, submit and the other steps,
uploads, «معرفی من», the sidebar item, the lazy check never running on public pages, the
login landing, the list's query count). `website/test_blog.py`:
the menu migration, the navbar rule, the teachers page link. Factories in
`blog/testing.py`.
